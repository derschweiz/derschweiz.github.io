They should do Truman Show II.
Lock Truman in the dome and see
if he will go back to work.

God said you are an atheist.
You are stupid as fuck.
I proved God with NIST.
Holy shit you are a retard.

Of course, Fraiser is confused.  He's an atheist.

28340 16:1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
28341 Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses
28342 saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred
28343 bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of
28344 wine.
28345
28346 16:2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
28347 said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread
28348 and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as
28349 be faint in the wilderness may drink.
28350
28351 16:3 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said
28352 unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day
28353 shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
28354
28355 16:4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
28356 unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may
28357 find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
